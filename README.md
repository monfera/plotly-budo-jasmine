# plotly-budo-jasmine [work in progress]
A quick test environment for plotly.js testing with budo and jasmine

An autoloading test harness that can run jasmine tests. 

Solution for `require`-ing `plotly.js` contents from the outside is with `linklocal`, suggested by [Ricky Reusser](http://rickyreusser.com/).

`plotly.js` contents by [Étienne Tétreault-Pinard](https://github.com/etpinard) and members of the [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) team.
